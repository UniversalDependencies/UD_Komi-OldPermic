# Summary

This is an Universal Dependencies treebank of Old Permic. The treebank is currently under progress, and will be published completely in the next Universal Dependencies release (v2.14), which is scheduled for May 15, 2024 (data freeze on May 1).

# Introduction

Old Permic, also known as Old Komi, is an extinct variety of Komi that was spoken in the late Middle Ages in the lower Vychegda river basin in northeastern European Russia, in an area that currently is not Komi-speaking. This language variety is attested in fragmentary records from the 14th to 17th century written both in the Old Permic alphabet and in the Cyrillic alphabet. These records are of significant importance for research on the history of the Komi language. Here we introduce our attempt towards a new Universal Dependencies treebank that will contain the existing corpus of Old Permic in a structured and CONLLU annotated format.
